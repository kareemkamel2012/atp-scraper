# atp-scraper

This was part of the project in my tennis-predictions repo.
It scrapes the ATP website for tournament results and 
singles rankings. It was cool locally, but was obnoxious to deploy and run on a server. I ended up using manual input and an external
API to replace its functionality. Nonetheless, it was a fun project and I learned a lot about web scraping, so I want to keep the source code on my github. The best way to use this is realistically
to run scraper.py locally in interactive mode and call then functions, but I left the lambda function code in just for fun.
